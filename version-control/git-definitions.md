# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
1. Version control is the ability to track how your files have changed.
2. It is useful as you can roll back any changes if need be, and can see who has made them.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
1. A branch is a copy of the master files where you can make changes and test features without losing your original master code.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
1. A commit is when you have made changes to the files in a repository, you have added them to the queue to update the repository, and you chose to "commit" the changes you made to the repository. A good commit message describes the changes you made in the most recent update.
* What is a merge conflict?
1. A merge conflict happens when there are disagreeing/conflicting changes in both of the repositories you are trying to merge.
