Michael H. Glaser Review and Reflect.
1)Data structures are useful in programming because it allows us to arrange
data in a useful structure/container in order to perform multiple operations
and calculations on them in a structured method.

2) An arrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object.
Each element in an array is associated with and referred to by an index.
3)
Example 1: Car Manufactures = ["car_company1", "car_company_2", etc..]
Example 2: grocery_stores = [safeway, whole_foods, berkeley_bowl]

4) A Hash is a collection of key-value pairs.
5)Motorcycle_manufactures_countryorigin = {
  "Yamaha" => "Japan"
  "Triump" => "UK"
  "Buell" => "US"
}

persons_haircolor = {
  "John" => "brown"
  "Bill" => "blonde"
  "Jake" => "black"
}

6) Iteration are commands that will allow us to run code for each individual
item in a array or hash.  It reduces the code required as instead of having to
index everything manually, you can tell the program to do everything for each
piece of data in your array or hash.
7) An example of iteration would be if a user had to input their name into a
list and then have the list sort the entire array alphabetically.

8) A Ruby block is a way of grouping statements, and may appear only in the
source adjacent to a method call; the block is written starting on the same
line as the method call's last parameter (or the closing parenthesis of the
parameter list). The code in the block is not executed at the time it is
encountered. Instead, Ruby remembers the context in which the block appears
(the local variables, the current object, etc) and then enters the method.
9) A block parameter is something you define when calling the block which
the block will use to iterate with. You define it by placing it between two
pipes ||.
